May 2004
--------

Pod::PerlPoint now accepts embedded PerlPoint:

  =for perlpoint
  A \I<PerlPoint> text

  =begin perlpoint

  @|
  column 1 | column 2
  cell 1   | cell 2
  cell 3   | cell 4

  =end perlpoint


Bugfix: X<word> was translated into \X<word>, while its meaning is
        \X{mode=index_only}<word>.


January 2003:
-------------

Headlines are now preceded by explicit empty lines, avoiding trouble with first
headline detection (which could be recognized as text before).

Bugfix in \L tag generation: Pod::PerlPoint 0.02 produced "a" options instead
of "url".

The special variable $__pod2pp__empty__ is now set up in the generated PerlPoint
source, a user has no longer to take care of it.




December 2002:
--------------

Reimplementation on base of Pod::Simple.





September 2002:
---------------

Version 0.01, derived from Pod::Text, on base on Pod::Parser.
It worked fine, but unfortunately Pod::Parser did not offer direct string processing.

Never releaed on CPAN.
