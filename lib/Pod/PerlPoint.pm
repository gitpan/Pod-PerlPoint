=head1 NAME

B<Pod::PerlPoint> - a POD to PerlPoint converter class

=head1 VERSION

This manual describes version B<0.03>.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 # load the module
 use Pod::PerlPoint;

 # build an object
 $d=new Pod::PerlPoint;

 # process the POD source
 $d->parse_file($podFile);


=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<Pod::PerlPoint> is a translator class to transform POD documents into PerlPoint
sources. It is based on C<Pod::Simple::Methody> and inherits all its capabilities, so please
see the docs of C<Pod::Simple::Methody> for advanced features.

Once you have transformed a POD document into PerlPoint, it may be furtherly processed
using the PerlPoint utilities.

If you prefer, you do not need to perform an explicit transformation. Beginning with
release 0.38, C<PerlPoint::Package> can process POD sources directly. Please see
C<PerlPoint::Parser> for details, or the documentation that comes with PerlPoint.

=head1 METHODS

This module directly provides a constructor only. As C<Pod::PerlPoint> is a subclass
of <Pod::Simple::Methody>, all the methods of this parent class are available as well.

The constructor takes the exactly same parameters as C<Pod::Simple::Methody::new()>,
please see there for details.

# = POD TRAILER SECTION =================================================================

=pod

=head1 NOTES


=head2 Nested lists

List nesting is I<not> transformed by this version. This means that the list points
are translated, but without taking care of possibly nested levels.


=head2 Text list entries

POD knows text lists, which are made hyperlink anchors implicitly. To reflect this
best, C<Pod::PerlPoint> transforms them into I<subchapters>.


=head2 Hyperlink support

The C<L> tag has several special meanings in POD, see L<perlpodspec>. Especially you
can link into other POD documents, even by section. Contrary to this, other POD sources
are unknown when a translation into PerlPoint is processed.

So currently C<Pod::Perlpoint> only supports two types of hypelinks:

=over 4

=item Hyperlinks to external addresses

Example:

 L<http://use.perl.org>

Such a link is transformed using PerlPoints C<\L> tag.

  \L{url="http://use.perl.org"}<http://use.perl.org>

=item Links to other sections of the same document

Example:

 L</Section>

Such a link us transformed using PerlPoints C<\REF> tag. In case the POD author
used an invalid link, the generated links is made optional.

  \REF{type=linked occasion=1 name="Section"}<"Section">



=head2 Variable $__pod2pp__empty__

A PerlPoint variable C<$__pod2pp__empty__> is used to start text paragraphs with, to avoid
conflicts caused by startup characters that are special to PerlPoint, but just text in POD.

It is assumed that this variable is not used elsewhere. The generated PerlPoint unsets
it to make sure it is really empty.


=head2 POD index Tag

The POD index tag C<X> is supported and translated into its PerlPoint equivalent, C<\X>.



=head2 Credits

This module is strongly based on Pod::Simple::Text. Thanks to its author
Sean M. Burke.
