January 2003:
-------------

Headlines are now preceded by explicit empty lines, avoiding trouble with first
headline detection (which could be recognized as text before).

Bugfix in \L tag generation: Pod::PerlPoint 0.02 produced "a" options instead
of "url".

The special variable $__pod2pp__empty__ is now set up in the generated PerlPoint
source, a user has no longer to take care of it.




December 2002:
--------------

Reimplementation on base of Pod::Simple.





September 2002:
---------------

Version 0.01, derived from Pod::Text, on base on Pod::Parser.
It worked fine, but unfortunately Pod::Parser did not offer direct string processing.

Never releaed on CPAN.
