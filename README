INTRO

This distribution provides a module Pod::PerlPoint to transform POD
documents into the PerlPoint format, and a script pod2pp that makes
such conversion simple, in the tradition of the various pod2...
utilities around.


INSTALLATION

As usual, unpack the distribution file and call

 make test install distclean

After that, you should be able to call pod2pp directly.

 pod2pp

Please use option -help to display a short usage message. 


DOCUMENTATION

Documentation is provided both with the module and the script
- inline and in POD format ;-)

As Pod::PerlPoint subclasses Pod::Simple (from version 0.02 on),
most documentation about this module might be find in the docs
of Pod::Simple or Pod::Simple::Methody, respectively.


LIMITS

Due to the definitions of indentation in POD and Perlpoint, list
nesting is currently not supported. All lists are translated,
but nesting is ignored. This might change in a future version.



SUPPPORT

A PerlPoint mailing list is set up to discuss usage, ideas,
bugs, suggestions and translator development. To subscribe,
please send an empty message to perlpoint-subscribe@perl.org.

If you prefer, you can contact me via perl@jochen-stenzel.de
as well.



CREDITS

Thanks to Sean M. Burke for the Pod::Simple modules which made
it simple to write this package and already provided most
of the functionality needed.
