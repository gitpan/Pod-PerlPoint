0.06
----

Added Perlpoint::Import::POD module, according to the parsers (0.43)
new standard import filter API. Significant parts of the source come
from the POD import filter of PerlPointCD which is used for years
to produce German Perl Workshop CDs, so this is stable code.
	
	

December 2004
-------------

Prepared for PerlPoint::Parser 0.40, which will no longer interpret
unset or reset variables. For this reason, the $__pod2pp__empty__
variable cannot be used to guard generated text paragraphs when
producing for a modern parser.

Luckily, the 0.40 parser introduces dotted text paragraphs, which
are exactly what we need. So, a new method Pod::PerlPoint::configure()
can switch to dotted texts. Likewise, a new option -parserversion
tells pod2pp which parser shall process the generated texts, and
adapts its Pod::PerlPoint handling accordingly:

  pod2pp -parserversion 0.40 ...


May 2004
--------

Pod::PerlPoint now accepts embedded PerlPoint:

  =for perlpoint
  A \I<PerlPoint> text

  =begin perlpoint

  @|
  column 1 | column 2
  cell 1   | cell 2
  cell 3   | cell 4

  =end perlpoint


Bugfix: X<word> was translated into \X<word>, while its meaning is
        \X{mode=index_only}<word>.


January 2003:
-------------

Headlines are now preceded by explicit empty lines, avoiding trouble with first
headline detection (which could be recognized as text before).

Bugfix in \L tag generation: Pod::PerlPoint 0.02 produced "a" options instead
of "url".

The special variable $__pod2pp__empty__ is now set up in the generated PerlPoint
source, a user has no longer to take care of it.




December 2002:
--------------

Reimplementation on base of Pod::Simple.





September 2002:
---------------

Version 0.01, derived from Pod::Text, on base on Pod::Parser.
It worked fine, but unfortunately Pod::Parser did not offer direct string processing.

Never releaed on CPAN.
